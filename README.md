# StegaImageBitShift
Used to decrypt steganographic image files.

Instructions:
Add a text file with only hexidecimal numbers in the project foler. 
Hex numbers can be retrieved from images by going into an application like 
notepad++, EditPad Pro, or HxD, opening up a jpg, and copying the hex numbers to a text file.

Version 1 Console:
- Is hex ---> hex.

Version 2 Console upcoming:
- hex ---> .jpg (or any image extension)

May take more time but can be done:
- .jpg ----> .jpg

Project is used for images that are encrypted. Hackers can apply an XOR, AND, OR, simple hex shift to
obfuscate the real image file.
